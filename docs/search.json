It seemed to me\nthat the confluence of predictive modeling, rigorous statistics, and\nstudy design would be exciting, powerful and useful. On the way I picked\nup an interest and fondness for data visualization as a storytelling\ntool.\nAfter my doctoral work at the University of Washington\nand postdoctoral training at the National Cancer Institute, where I\nlearned about epidemiologic studies, study design and bioinformatics, I\nspent a few years at Thomas\nJefferson University supporting the Kimmel Cancer Center, before\ncoming back to Washington DC. The next decade were spent back at NIH in\nthe National Institute for\nArthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases working in outcomes\nresearch, epidemiology and administrative databases for rheumatology\nresearch, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and ankolysing\nspondylitis. I then changed paths and joined AstraZeneca as a data scientist\nsupporting Oncology R&D, thus completing the trifecta of academia,\ngovernment and industry. During this time, I also consulted widely,\nhelping with workforce optimization (USPS), signal processing, business\nanalytics and grants; I co-founded a health sensor startup, Zansors along the way.\nOver the years, as my hair has turned greyer, I have increasing\ninterests in teaching and mentoring, having taught aspects of statistics\nand data science in R and Python for many years across government (FAES @ NIH, State Department),\nindustry (Freddie Mac, Brookings Institute, Open Health Group/Pharmerit)\nand academia (Georgetown\nUniversity, George Mason University). Along with some friends in the\nDC area, I helped found the Statistical Programming\nDC meetup, which started in a conference room in Rockville, MD and\nexpanded to the Data Community\nDC with over 15,000 members in the DC area.\nOutside of all the technical stuff, I love spending time with my\nfamily and our golden retriever,learning things, reading books, and\nworking on and behind the stage in community theater. Over the years, my\nshower has witnessed an expanded repertoire of singing, promoted by my\nchildrens’ interests in musical theater. Through all of it is my aikido\npractice of over 25 years, which continues to teach me about life and\nthe realms of endless possibilities of the human mind and body.\nAbout this blog\nWhen doing data science work, I consider R my first language and Python my 1.5th language. I\nuse both on a daily basis, and interact with both to create bilingual\ndata science pipelines and workflows.\nI continue to learn and grow and develop better ways of\ndoing things both individually and collaboratively, and to be a more\neffective communicator of data science. One of the many ways I learn is\nto find ways of doing something in Python that I know how to do in R and\nvice versa. This blog has germinated with that idea of\nparallelism between R and Python, but promises to expand beyond that\nbetter ways of doing things in either, explore data visualization and\nother communication and storytelling devices, utilizing other resources,\nand occasionally ruminating on issues and topics that I come across in\nthe application of data science.\nThis blog serves as a journal to capture ideas, a medium to improve\ncommuncation, and perhaps a way to dessiminate knowledge and ideas that\nsome might find useful. Happy you’re here to share this journey…\n\n\n\n",
